MMU / MMU2S - SHELF FILAMENT PTFE GUIDE
=========

### About

Above my printers I have a shelf, that's supposed to be 28mm tall. I decided to place my filaments on the shelf. Upon measuring I discovered these shelves are actually 27.2mm tall.

The shelf isn't quite deep enough either, so I relocated the front feet from the holders to be a couple of cm back and built in a small step down into the top of the model.

I've included the STL file and also the F3D file, just in case you want to change something. You might notice a circle taken out of the inner side of the model. This only serves as a way to use less filament.

###Â Printing

In the pictures, I've not used any supports. This isn't a great print, so I'm printing the last 4 now with supports just to maintain the circular pattern. They don't have to be perfect, they just have to work.

### Accessories

* PTFE tubing - 2.5mm internal diameter, 4mm external diameter: https://amzn.to/2KILVZe
* PTFE connectors / couplers - I used these: https://amzn.to/37UbajY

The model has a thread for an M10 connector, getting it screwed in was slightly trickier than I would've liked, but I found clamping the connector into the thread while using a wrench was pretty easy.

### Setup

I have the 5 filaments next to each other, each one sitting on the supplied spool holders from Prusa. I found that using around 20cm of PTFE out of the bottom of the PTFE connector works well, and the overhang produced from the MMU unloading isn't terrible (there's a picture of this)

### In summary...

I hope you like this. Works well for me. Let me know if you have any issues!
